            <p class="answer hidden">A core belief is a thought, conscious or not, that shapes how an individual views themself and how interactions with others are perceived.
                For example, the core belief, "I am inadequate," may lead someone to feel hesitant to try new things.
                It may cause a feeling of shame or anxiety after engaging in an activity, even if such an activity was successful.
                This core belief may cause them perceive the passing comments and actions of others as being veiled criticisms.
                It may even produce additional social anxiety.

                <p>Thought distortions include common reasonings that feel valid but, in fact, lack evidence. 
                    A few examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Catastrophizing</li>

                    Our brains are amazing, so stop limiting it by telling yourself, “I can’t change.”

            <p class="answer hidden">No. CBT practitioners are not licensed therapists.
                However, they follow the same therapeutic pattern and can help get similar results in about the same amount of time.
                CBT practitioners can also be helpful as an intro to therapy if you are nervous, 
                providing affordable support while you search for the right therapist.

                The average program length is about 24 weeks. Of course, every person is different. 
                Some take to the concepts very quickly or already have habits which will lend themselves well to CBT, such as journaling. 
                Others may need a little longer. 
                For example, studies indicate that neurodivergent individuals do very well with CBT training but require more time to process the methods being taught.
                Still, once you have it, you have it! Once you have learned these skills, they can be applied to any situation in life. 
                Of course, you are always welcome to come back for a check-in anytime you feel it is needed.

            <p class="answer hidden">Sessions are held via video-conference. 
                They should be scheduled 5 days in advance either one at a time or in 4-week blocks via Calendly.
                Once scheduled, you will receive an appointment confirmation email with a Google Meet link.
                Each session lasts about 1 hour and follows a similar format.
                We will cover 2-3 agenda points relevant to your goals, decide on a helpful CBT exercise that you can apply during the week and review the progress from the previous week's exercise.
