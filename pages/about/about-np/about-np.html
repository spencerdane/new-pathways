            <h2>About New Pathways Cognitive Coaching</h2>

            <section id="about-np">
                <p>Over the years, I have seen how many with the desire to improve their emotional health are often limited by the high financial cost of therapy.
                    So, toward the end of my course in 2023, I began offering "practice sessions" to some I knew personally.
                </p>
                <p>The response was incredible. 
                    Those who had just a few sessions began recommending my services to others.
                    I quickly began to realize that, while some people need the help of a licensed therapist, others simply need a little coaching in order to identify their core beliefs and the thoughts that are robbing them of peace.
                        
                </p>
                <p>That's when the idea of New Pathways Cognitive Coaching first entered my head.
                    How wonderful it would be to have a platform for qualified CBT practitioners to offer guidance to those needing support at an affordable cost.
                </p>
                <p>I began working on a path that potential clients could follow to help them overcome common problems.
                    That path helps them to create new patterns of thinking - new pathways of thought.
                    The program I created takes you through about 6 months of CBT techniques.
                </p>

                                Establish your needs, values and goals. 
                                We are happiest when we live in harmony with our values.
                                However, with a little digging, many figure out that they have been living by somebody else's values or rules.
                                This can leave us feeling powerless in our own life like we are running on empty - guilty, drained and directionless. 
                                So, let’s figure out which direction you want to go and why you can be excited to get there!

                                Discover healthy, helpful habits, how to make them stick, and why they are important for brain health. 
                                We may cover things like getting better sleep, the power of "happy" movement and gratitude, breathing and grounding techniques, and the importance of the outdoors.
                                These things are not just free but can be done almost anywhere!  
                                During this section we will build you up so you feel confident enough to take on some of the more imposing, limiting thoughts which have been holding you back.

                                By this point you might be ready to recognize the tricks your brain can play on you, the inherited rules you have been sticking to, and how confimration bias could be stopping you from seeing opportunities for growth. 
                                We each have a story we have been telling ourselves over the years. Let's fact check it together.

                                Identify recurring themes that your thought distortions have in common.
                                See what your brain been subconsciously telling you.
                                Is this 100% true? 
                                Is this my own belief or one inherited at some point in my childhood? 
                                Does it actually help me in any way? 
                                Let’s find out how we can replace our core belief with something more accurate and helpful.

                                We will look at task management and maintenance. 
                                We might be tempted to jump into every big problem in life thinking we can simply “CBT it away.”
                                Like learning to drive a new car, it takes time to find the balance in how hard to brake and how fast to accelerate.
                                Your new CBT skills can take a little time and practice to balance.
                                In this section we will talk about how to do just that.
                                We will also do a summary and check-in on your initial goals and challenges.

                                Finally, it is time to put it all together and take stock of our new emotional tool kit. 
                                We can review which tools you have found helpful and where else you want to implement them in life.
                                Afterwards, you will be better prepared to adapt these tools in conquering those challenges.
                                These might include facing your fears, better decision-making, and setting up healthy boundaries.
