                <p>My name is Hannah Conrad.
                    When I was in my early 20's, I got to witness the power of CBT in my own life first-hand. 
                    In working with my own CBT therapist, I was amazed how a few simple techniques allowed me to emotionally recover from experiences in my own past.
                    Don't get me wrong; it took real work. The results made such an impact that over the next decade, I continuously looked for ways to apply these principles.
                    I looked for ways to help others apply them too.
                </p>
                <p>Then in 2023, my husband and I moved to Bangalore, India. 
                    This change afforeded me extra time which I was able to take courses in CBT.
                    I was thrilled to get a chance to get more involved with something I'm so passionate about.

                <h3>About New Pathways Cognitive Coaching</h3>
                <p>Over the years, I have seen how many with the desire to improve their emotional health are often limited by the high financial cost of therapy.
                    Well, toward the end of my course in 2023, I began offering "sessions" to some I knew personally.
                    The response was really incredible. Those who had just a few sessions began recommending my services to others.
                    I quickly began to realize that, while some people in the world need the help of a licensed therapist, others simply need a little guidance in identifying the core beliefs and thoughts that are robbing them of peace.
                    That's when the idea of New Pathways Cognitive Coaching first entered my head.    
                </p>
                <p>How wonderful it would be to have a platform for qualified CBT practitioners to offer guidance to those needing support at an affordable cost.
                   I began working on a path that potential clients could follow to help them overcome common problems.
                   That path helps them to create new patterns of thinking - new pathways of thought.
                   Then, in December 2023, New Pathways Cognitive Coaching was ready to begin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pathway I created takes you through about 6 months of CBT techniques.
                </p>

                    <p class="answer hidden">A core belief is a belief, conscious or not, that shapes how an individual views themself and how interactions with others are perceived.
                        For example, the core belief "I am inadequate," may lead someone to feel hesitant to try new things.
                        It may cause a feeling of shame or anxiety after engaging in an activity, even if such an activity was successful.
                        This core belief may cause them perceive the passing comments and actions of others as being veiled criticisms.
                        It may even produce additional social anxiety.

                        Many find it helpful to extend sessions in order to form concrete habits with the help of a CBT practitioner.
