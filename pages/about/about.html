                <p>My name is Hannah Conrad.
                    When I was in my early 20's, I got to witness first-hand the power of CBT. 
                    In working with my own CBT therapist, I was amazed how a few simple techniques allowed me to emotionally recover from past trauma.
                    It helped me let go of the emotional baggage I was still carrying with me.
                    Don't get me wrong; it took real work. The results made such an impact that over the next decade, I continuously looked for ways to apply these principles in my own life and to use them to help others.
                </p>
                <p>In 2023, my husband and I had the chance to move to Bangalore, India. 
                    This change afforded me extra time with which I was able to finally finish my CBT course.
                    I was thrilled to get a chance to get more involved with something I'm so passionate about.

                <h3>About New Pathways Cognitive Coaching</h3>
                <p>Over the years, I have seen how many with the desire to improve their emotional health are often limited by the high financial cost of therapy.
                    Well, toward the end of my course in 2023, I began offering "practice sessions" to some I knew personally.
                    The response was really incredible. Those who had just a few sessions began recommending my services to others.
                    I quickly began to realize that, while some people in the world need the help of a licensed therapist, others simply need a little guidance in identifying their core beliefs and the thoughts that are robbing them of peace.
                    That's when the idea of New Pathways Cognitive Coaching first entered my head.    
                </p>
                <p>How wonderful it would be to have a platform for qualified CBT practitioners to offer guidance to those needing support at an affordable cost.
                   I began working on a path that potential clients could follow to help them overcome common problems.
                   That path helps them to create new patterns of thinking - new pathways of thought.
                   Then in January 2024, New Pathways Cognitive Coaching was ready to begin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program I created takes you through about 6 months of CBT techniques.

                                We are happiest when we live in harmony with our values.
                                However, with a little digging, many figure out that they have been living by somebody else's values or rules.
                                This can leave us feeling powerless in our own life - guilty, drained and directionless.

                                We might be tempted to jump into every big problem in life thinking we can simply “CBT it away.”
                                Like learning to drive a new car, it takes time to find the balance in how hard to brake and how fast to accelerate.
                                Your new CBT skills can take a little time and practice to balance.
                                In this section we will talk about how to do just that.
                                We will also do a summary and check-in on your initial goals and challenges.

                                We can review which tools you have found helpful and where you want to implement them in life.
                                Afterwards, you will be better prepared to adapt these tools in conquering those challenges.
                                These might include facing your fears, better decision-making, and setting up healthy boundaries.

                    <p class="answer hidden">A core belief is a thought, conscious or not, that shapes how an individual views themself and how interactions with others are perceived.
                        For example, the core belief, "I am inadequate," may lead someone to feel hesitant to try new things.
                        It may cause a feeling of shame or anxiety after engaging in an activity, even if such an activity was successful.
                        This core belief may cause them perceive the passing comments and actions of others as being veiled criticisms.
                        It may even produce additional social anxiety.

                    <p class="answer hidden">No. CBT practitioners are not licensed therapists.
                        However, they follow the same therapeutic pattern and can help get similar results in about the same amount of time.
                        CBT practitioners can be helpful as an intro to therapy if you are nervous about taking the plunge.
                        They can also provide affordable support while you search for the right therapist.

                        The average program length is about 24 weeks. Of course, every person is different. 
                        Some take to the concepts very quickly or already have habits which will lend themselves well to CBT, such as journaling. 
                        Others may need a little longer. 
                        For example, studies indicate that neurodivergent individuals do very well with CBT training but require more time to process the methods being taught.
                        Still, once you have it, you have it; Once you have learned these skills, they can be applied to any situation in life. 
                        Of course, you are always welcome to come back for a check-in anytime you feel it is needed.

                        They should be scheduled 5 days in advance either one at a time or in 4-week blocks via <a href="../contact/contact.html" >Calendly</a>.
                        Once scheduled, you will receive an appointment confirmation email with a Google Meet link.
                        Each session lasts about 1 hour and follows a similar format.
                        We will cover 2-3 agenda points relevant to your goals, decide on a helpful CBT exercise that you can apply during the week and review the progress from the previous week's exercise.
